<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Uninlined CPU flame graphs visualize code that is consuming CPUs, and attempts to uninline application frames so that full stacks are shown (currently only supports Java). This widget works using a profiler that does timed sampling of stack traces at 49 Hertz, on all running CPUs. It runs as a background task until the profile is completed.<p>

<h4>Overhead</h4>

<p>This should have negligible overhead while profiling, and then a short period (seconds) of a single CPU runtime at the end as symbols are collected and the flame graph generated.</p>

<h4>CPU Profiling</h4>

<p>Timed sampling of stack traces is a common industry method for understanding CPU usage with low overhead. This is different to tracing of all functions/methods, which is performed by some CPU profilers and costs high overhead and often skews results (observer effect).</p>

<h4>Flame Graph Visualization</h4>

<p>The x-axis shows the stack profile population, sorted alphabetically (it is not the passage of time), and the y-axis shows stack depth. Each rectangle represents a stack frame. The wider a frame is is, the more often it was present in the profile. The top edge shows what is on-CPU, and beneath it is its ancestry. Different color hues are used for different code types, and the saturation is randomized to differentiate between frames.</p>

<h4>Common Issues</h4>

<p><b>Broken stacks:</b> If the runtime does not expose a stack walker that the profiler can use (commonly frame-pointer based), then stack traces will be broken and ancestry will be missing. This is usually visible as a "bed of grass": thin frames all at the same level. The fix depends on the runtime and stack walking technique. Eg, to use frame-pointer walking with Java, Java must be run with -XX:+PreserveFramePointer.</p>

<p><b>Missing symbols:</b> JIT runtimes need to export a symbol file for the profiler to use. This depends on the runtime. Java should be handled automatically by Vector, making use of perf-map-agent. Node.js currently needs to run with --perf_basic_prof_only_funcitons or --perf_basic_prof.</p>
