      <h4>Summary</h4>

      <p>CPU flame graphs visualize code that is consuming CPUs. This widget works using a profiler that does timed sampling of stack traces at 49 Hertz, on all running CPUs. It runs as a background task until the profile is completed.</p>

      <h4>Overhead</h4>

      <p>This should have negligible overhead while profiling, and then a short period (seconds) of a single CPU runtime at the end as symbols are collected and the flame graph generated.</p>

      <h4>CPU Profiling</h4>

      <p>Timed sampling of stack traces is a common industry method for understanding CPU usage with low overhead. This is different to tracing of all functions/methods, which is performed by some CPU profilers and costs high overhead and often skews results (observer effect).</p>

      <h4>Flame Graph Visualization</h4>

      <p>The x-axis shows the stack profile population, sorted alphabetically (it is not the passage of time), and the y-axis shows stack depth. Each rectangle represents a stack frame. The wider a frame is is, the more often it was present in the profile. The top edge shows what is on-CPU, and beneath it is its ancestry. Different color hues are used for different code types, and the saturation is randomized to differentiate between frames.</p>
